title: Sigh, AngularJS Documentation
---

I was having hard time to document my angularJS directive, https://github.com/allenhwkim/angularjs-google-maps. The following is the list of documentation tools I have tried and built
 
<!--more-->

## 1. [docular](https://github.com/gitsome/docular)

 **Pretty but not simple**

 We can follow [this guide](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Writing-AngularJS-Documentation), then run this docular to generate documentation

 Pros:

 * It generates the exactly the same style of AngularJS documentation from your code
 * It follows the same tagging that AngularJS Code
 *  Clone of AngularJS Documentation Engine

 Cons: 

 * Need to start a server to see the documentation
 * Dependent on grunt and grunt-docular
 * Requires grunt-docular configuration
 * So many custom tags to learn
 * and more configuration, tl;dr

## 2. [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/)

 Simple but not pretty

 Pros:  

 * No server is required to see the documentation
 * Command line available

 Cons:  

 * group by classes, modules, etc, but not group by controllers, directives, filters, etc
 * No fancy output. i.e. http://gitgrimbo.github.io/jsdoc3-examples/jsdoc/

## 3. [dgeni](https://github.com/angular/dgeni)

 Dgeni is a documentation generator developed by the Angular team.

 pros:  

 * angularjs family use this; angularjs, protractor, and ionic

 cons :   

 * complex; no guide, no tutorial, nor documentation
 * so many steps; 14 steps of document generation(pros?)

## 4. [Allen's Conclusion](https://github.com/allenhwkim/angular-jsdoc)

 Why can't we just have simple documentation generator like javaDoc?
 JSDoc works like a javaDoc,but it's not customized for AngularJS.
 Then, if I customize JSDoc for AngularJS using plugin and template....?

 Ok, let me make that template and plugin for AngularJS, 

 .... A week later, 

 Tada ~~

 </a>

 Pros:  

 * It's just JSDoc template designed for AngularJS
 * Taking advantage of all JSDoc Simplicity
 * group by @ngdoc tag values; controller, directive, service, or any

 Cons:  

 * Still not pretty design
 * Maybe more that I don't think of at the moment

 I wish this helps someone who wants to do document AngularJS code.
