<p>To find common elements from multiple ruby arrays, use bitwise operator and, &#39;&amp;&#39;, not and operator,&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;
<!--more--></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] &amp; [4,1,5] &amp; [6,7,1] &amp; [8,8,8,1]
=&gt; [1]
</code></pre><p>On the contrary,  to find unique elements from multiple arrays, you can use bitwise operator or, &#39;|&#39;</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [1,2,3] | [4,1,5] | [6,7,1] | [8,8,8,1]
=&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
</code></pre><p>In common sense, this bitwise operator should not work, but ruby Array defines its own method :&amp; and :| for convenience. </p>

<p>Therefore, there is no bitwise calculation going on with array when use &quot;&amp;&quot; or &quot;|&quot;, but you simply call method &amp;(unique), |(intersect). it is confusing as a Java/C/Erlang backgrounded programmer, but it is also very convenient.</p>
