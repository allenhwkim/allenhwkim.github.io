<p>Someone may say HTML is too long and has too many classes, and someone may say HTML has too many details for functionalities.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, I would like to have longer HTML than longer Javascript. The reason is simple. HTML is visible, readable, and fault-tolerant, but Javascript is not visible nor readable, and not fault-tolerant. </p>
<p>CSS is not visible and readable, but it is very fault-talerant.
By making common classes and putting those into HTML, we can make it is as visible and readable.</p>
