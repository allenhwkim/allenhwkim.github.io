<p>I have started this article with the title of &quot;Why AngularJS So Difficult&quot;, and my answer to it is, because <strong>&quot;We are still thinking HTML/Javascript-Together&quot;</strong>, and we are not really thinking &quot;HTML-first&quot;. All three sections mentioned in this article are all about HTML.</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML is Dynamic As Defined</li>
<li>AngularJS is Declarative Not Imperative</li>
<li>AngularJS is HTML-centric</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you really think &quot;HTML can express everything&quot;? If you can answer it as yes, AngularJS gets easier. </p>
<p>Then, what is Javascript for AngularJS? It is only, only to make HTML work. So, define HTML declarative enough, then make that HTML work with Javascript.</p>
<p>AngularJS 2.0 is on its way, and it is not a refactored version of 1.3, but a rewritten from the scratch with ES6. Everything will change; controller, scope, direct injection, and even coding style. However, one thing does not change in 2.0 is &quot;HTML-centric Principle&quot;.</p>
<p>Next, I will write about AngularJS coding style, which is somewhat difficult for jQuery or vanilla Javascript developers.</p>
