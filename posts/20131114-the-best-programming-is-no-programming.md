title: The Best Programming Is No Programming
---

For example, there is a requirement to count the words in a document.

We need to ;
  
    1. build test requirements
    2. code parse string and count unique word 
    3. compile/link, run
    4. more test, code, and run
<!--more-->

Instead, as a good programmer and as who don't want to program, I would run this; 
 
    $ wc
