<h1 id="human-vs-nature">Human vs. Nature</h1>
<p>When there was no human, Nature thrived.
When human thrived, nature suffered.

<p>Convincing nature is not dumb, 
the more attack happens to nature by human,
the more attempt will be to hurt human from nature.</p>
<p>So far, we are still thinking nature is dumb, 
which have maintained its perfection for millions of years.</p>
